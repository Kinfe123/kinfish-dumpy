In this blog post, we'll dive into the world of most of Tailwind UI-based component libraries and UI utilities. Tailwind CSS has gained immense popularity in the web development community for its utility-first approach to styling, and many developers have leveraged this framework to create comprehensive component libraries and UI tools.



 So let cook them together


## Shadcn/ui 

[**Shadcn**](https://ui.shadcn.com) - is not ui library but ,If there's one Tailwind UI library that straight-up dominated the scene in 2023, it's gotta be shadcn/ui, man. This bad boy is built on top of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI as a primitive, and it's bringing a whole new approach to the game â€“ you just copy and paste the code for any component you need right into your project, giving you full ownership and control. The trade-off is you won't get those automatic updates, so your dev team's gotta be on point to handle the maintenance, but if you've got the chops, this level of customization is gonna be a game-changer, letting you make those components look and feel exactly how you want.
