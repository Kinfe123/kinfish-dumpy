In this blog post, we'll dive into the world of most of Tailwind UI-based component libraries and UI utilities. Tailwind CSS has gained immense popularity in the web development community for its utility-first approach to styling, and many developers have leveraged this framework to create comprehensive component libraries and UI tools.



 So let cook them together


## Shadcn/ui 

[**Shadcn**](https://ui.shadcn.com) - is not ui library but ,If there's one Tailwind UI library that straight-up dominated the scene in 2023, it's gotta be shadcn/ui, man. This bad boy is built on top of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI as a primitive, and it's bringing a whole new approach to the game – you just copy and paste the code for any component you need right into your project, giving you full ownership and control. The trade-off is you won't get those automatic updates, so your dev team's gotta be on point to handle the maintenance, but if you've got the chops, this level of customization is gonna be a game-changer, letting you make those components look and feel exactly how you want.


btw i got got a couple of pr i made the both for feat: and fix: hopefully they will live soon

## NextUI
[**Nextui**](https://nextui.org) - Yo, despite the name, Next UI has got nothin' to do with Next.js, my man. But don't sleep on this bad boy – since v2.0, it's been built on the unstoppable combo of Tailwind CSS and React Aria, and it's one of the fastest-growing Tailwind-based UI libraries out there, hands down. The deal with Next UI is simple: you just import the React components from the @nextui-org/react npm package and start using 'em in your app. No extra hassle, no hoops to jump through – just straight-up, high-powered UI components ready to level up your project. And let me tell you, these components are clean, they're versatile, and they're packed with features that'll have your users sayin', "Damn, this is smooth." Tremor, another Tailwind-powered library, might get some shine, but Next UI is really takin' the scene by storm right now. If you're lookin' to bring some next-level UI to your app, this is the way to go, my friend.
