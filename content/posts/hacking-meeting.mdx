You know guys... when I was at the company, I used to attend meetings with a lot of people three times a day. Yeah, I know, it's so tiresome, and programmers are too lazy for this, though. "Talk is cheap, show me the code" was from Linus Torvalds, if I'm not mistaken.

Yeah, I decided to automate it. Hopefully, the meeting link is attached to the calendar invite. What I did was try to create a bot, kind of thing along with a webhook, to automate the hooking from the calendar based on their time and join the meeting using some scrapper tools. Yeah, it went pretty well. I thought it would be somehow buggy, but it was not that much buggy. The first time I joined the meeting based on the bot, yeah, I was too excited, and I thought a lot of things that I can do if I didn't attend the meeting because it was like time-consuming - 40+ minutes was really time-consuming, man. Yeah, my muscle was like this.

I fetched the data from the calendar -> check the arrival time -> when it reaches, it pops out the meeting link and joins the meeting. I was pretty happy with that. But then, I said, wait, what if I extend this further? Like, what if I get called in a meeting by the presenter or meeting leader to explain my task? Yeah, as you can see, we are going somewhere near AI. Yeah, it actually is. I want to feed AI about my current update, and I want it to give a summary based on the data I feed it. Or like ToD - topic of the day - and to kind of impersonate me and talk like me, which would be voice processing intensive, like making sure to listen for keywords that concern me, like my name, the task I am working on, or something like that.

I want that AI to explain, but not only that, I want the AI to take a summary note for that. I guess I can use external services like voice-intensive LLM out there, like Fehem - the famous one. I guess she is a girl, no offense ðŸ˜‚, for AI. Yeah, or I can build the native one there for some specific purpose of mine. I really want to make it more specific to meeting stuff. I guess there is also one closer to meeting utilities I may check out for API ðŸ˜„. Yeah, the guess developers have to take this issue so seriously that we have a win-win situation.

Assuming we had some meeting-oriented job, all of the API-featured stuff is not implemented yet, but a non-AI version of it is there on a [GitHub](https://github.com/Kinfe123/AutoJoin-Meeting-From-Calendar.) repository, which was a while ago. Yeah, I wish you all stand with me. For those who don't have meetings, you don't need external effort, but I am definitely sure at some point you need some such kind of services, not only for devs but also other professionals. I believe this is not being lazy, and we do need to opt out from a bloated calendar. Hopefully, you find it insightful. I need it as a billionaire dollar idea, but I'll let you guys steal it ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜„. Yeah, we need to make that happen.
