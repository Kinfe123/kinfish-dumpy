## Just rough overview of my experience from interviews


- Yeah , One thing I have learned on having an interview with big tech companies is like you should always be talking to the end of the interview starting from a very first start like you should be making your self as leader like a team player plus ask a lot of questions - trust me on this + know exactly what the company values and principles from their website which is crucial for the question - 'why do you wanna join us' so guys where even not in big tech but other interview try being a team player as much as possible with out any grand exaggeration .. just keep it smooth ... Being nervous is so normal.. even I told him that I am so nervous so that he gave 2 or 3 min to relax and he was even talking me about other stuff like school and stuff like that + after you do all this time there is a time where you being asked about the project and stuff like that and mentioning about opensource contribution is heck keypoint with your contribution proof like what you actually did , what changed after your change and stuff like that ...since it is the actual replica of the work environment you will be working on except on closed source projects .
- Yeah communication communication communication communication is really key you got have to take it consideration and take it really seriously over the technical side I can say... Honestly the technical questions was not that bad rather it was easy like he asked me to implement MRU - mostly recently used - you can call it as new varient of data structure but here there is some rule on ordering and putting stuff plus removing and inserting .
- Yeah as the name implies it is just there will be a set of operation you need to do on most recently used value from your **MRU** data structure implementation which was the opposite of LRU which is the most famous interview questiosn and yeah first I allow my self to explain my thought process plus what data structure like nested data structure am gonna be using while implementing the algorithm + data structure and I just went through the farming approach so called brute force and explained to him why it does not scale as our input size grows which have a direct correlation with our output beside any auxiliary space since I ain't use any..and yeah coming up with brute force solution is so crucial so that even you even showed him how well you understood the question but also you will have a credit on doing so ..
- so that even it can helps you on optimizing the code interms of time or space complexity yeah the brute force one took me about 5 min and I went to trying out the optimized approach which is somehow hard by that time plus the pressure yeah I just trying calming my self and continued explaining why brute force does not work and we need to optimize further and yeah with 3 or 4 minute I came up with some optimization which I really did interms of operation optimization like insertion and deletion and some other operation was a bit time and space costy which I optimized them later to constant time operation instead of avg O(n) time complexity and and I just went over writing the pseudo code while explaining my thoughts and I explained the fine details about why I did choose some data structure instead of other and stuff like that and yeah told him and explained him at my best which I hoped he understood my approach very clear and he was happy by my solution since we were having a fun at some point me trying to explain some crazy word that I usually use in amahric and getting a stutter Infront of him ðŸ¤£ which was kind of funny by that time and we both laughed and he requested me to calm down for more time if I need so. Yeah after about 10 min I finished implementing my solution and finished the analysis like auxiliary space , time , space , operation wise and stuff like that . More or less this was a bit of my experience with the company and we even shared our linkedin , by the end it was somehow a kind of question like what you major accomplishments, what is you proudest moment on your career - for me it was participating on hackaton and contributing to opensource project which he was really interested of listening to , we have talked about some of the contribution that I have done and why I did that , the impact , the pros and cons all of the flaws and by the end he asked me if I do have a question for him and I said nope and we have shared our good byes and that was the end of the interview process and after that I have doubt a lot of mistake which I did while the interview and which was not that bad but still something that need to addressed. And for further questions I'm might have another blog like a part 2 explaining a detail of my experience on that. Other than that I still don't know the result but I don't know if it will goes as I expected or not .. there were a mistake that I did but I really do well on technical + expressing my thought . And if anybody who guessed a company will have **100ETB card** except for this fellas who knows.   **sorry** for long post ;) guys .. hope you get lucky on this
